  1. Data and information strongly relate to each other. Data is raw, unorganized facts/ contexts that need to be processed. Data can be simple, random and even useless until it is organized. Information is data that is processed, organized, structured in a given context, purposely and usefully.

  2. Dimensional aspect is what makes mapping and visualization different. Visualization can be seen as a particular subset of mapping, is limited to a typical visual representation, for example 2D graphics. The concept of mapping is larger, which can apply on 4D, the XYZ plane and time. Mapping allows for more control of what can be viewed.

  3. Manovich states that visualization is anti-sublime because it illustrates “something visible and tangible.” It can take something that is thought of as too big for human understanding and contract it into something visually understandable. Manovich mentions how  Romantic art illustrates the sublime, feelings and senses that are beyond human comprehension. Visualization can be seen as the opposite of that. I would say I agree with this argument. The goal of visualization is to create something understandable, to take something that is too grand for comprehension and make it comprehensible.

  4. She started as an employee for some big tech companies. Then, she started her own mobile telecommunications company, but ended up quitting 10 years later. She starts off by mentioning how everything about us is known, our data is out there.
  She then introduces how she began creating her data art.
  One of the first ones being a piece that illustrated her sleep pattern and a bunch of other people’s.
  It showed the difference between her and other people.
  She illustrated how all this data about us can be translated into visual patterns.
  It also helps define us indirectly.
  Data can be utilized in ways that we usually wouldn’t imagine.
  Things about us as consumers and people can be easily predicted with all the data that is collected about us. She states that it is more about identity. Something I noticed about her artwork is that it is very geometrically oriented. A lot of the visualization of the data she used conveyed through geometrical patterns. Typically circles and squares. Color is also used as another means of depicting it.
