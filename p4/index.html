<h1> P5JS Project: K/DA Music Visualizer </h1>

     <p>
    Interface and Language Track 
  </p><br><p>
    I decided to advance my exercise 9 and develop it into a more complex project. This final project is which I focus on making a visualizer for a music track of the virtual Kpop girl band called K/DA from the famous game League of Legend.
    I think that each instrumental tracks can have their own forms of visuals. For example, in my project, I used K/DA's song "The Baddest" and splitted the audio track
    into individuals, for example: drum, bass, synth, vocals, etc. Then, for each of them, I map their amplitude to the visuals, so that each scene has a unique representation for a specific instrumental layer.
     I also cut some short samples that are used in the track to make some add-on sound effects and to create animations for them. I hope users/ players can learn more about sound design and have fun playing around with the instrumental tracks.
